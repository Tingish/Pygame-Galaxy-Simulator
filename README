This is a universal gravitation simulator I made in a few hours over the course of a train ride last year.
I was just curious to see if I could simulate such phenomena as stable orbits and galactic formations.
Gravity.py is the file that contains the objects and methods. It defines the algorithm for numerically calculating the forces on each object.
Gravity_crunch.py is the first file you need to run. It will crunch through all the numbers and produce a separate (large) file of pickled data.
Gravity_run.py is the fun part. It takes the data from the external file and runs through step-by-step, displaying the objects as simple dots using the pygame blit function.

Have fun changing the numbers around in Gravity.py. Different number of objects, different masses, different starting positions. It's all good.
